zkDpos is a scaling and privacy engine for Alaya. Its current functionality scope includes low gas transfers of ATP
and ARC20 tokens in the Alaya network.

## Description

- Based on Alaya public chain, we develop and connect uni + Bancor swap + AMM order book DAPP, and add privacy transaction calculation based on ZK rollups technology. One can compress data and privacy protection function, automatic market making swap + AMM DEX, realize the privacy function of transaction calculation.
- Because the data on the chain has no privacy, any transaction on the chain will be exposed, and the simple dexswap makes any transaction data public. The complex and redundant calculation logic data is exposed, which makes the transaction easier to be exploited and attacked by attackers. For example, it is caught by the opposite party in the process of hanging up an order to peek at the order in advance, which is easy to cause transaction losses. Zk-snark technology is used to move the real-time online chain to offline computing, with zero knowledge proof, so that key transactions will not be disclosed, and the whole trusted computing process can be completed, which not only improves the computing efficiency of the blockchain, but also protects the user's privacy data, and optimizes the user's whole experience
